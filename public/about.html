<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Abhay here, 32. I am not the most talkative guy, and prefer my work to do the talk.
   You can check my portfolio here 
    As you can see, I custom-coded a variety of websites,
     ranging from simple e-shops to complex platforms with a variety of functions.
     On some of these projects I worked alone, but on some I worked on a team and definitely enjoy teamwork.
     Except of my work, which is my greatest passion, I enjoy running and cycling.
     Honestly think it is important to balance the long hours we spend
      in front of a computer screen with some physical activity,
      and thatâ€™s exactly what I do in my leisure time.</p>
